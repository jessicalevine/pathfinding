# Pathfinding
This is a demonstration of the A\* pathinding algorithm using the Manhattan heuristic, built on top of the Gosu 2D game engine, and using the public domain RLTiles tileset.

# Installation
Assuming you have a UNIX-like system, and ruby installed, use the following sequence of commands to install and run Pathfinding:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:mrjordangoldstein/pathfinding.git
$ pathfinding/bin/pathfinding
```

If you use rvm, change into the pathfinding directory, and the rvmrc should change to the tested ruby version and create a gemset.

Tested on Ruby 1.9.3-p194 on Mac OSX Lion.

# Attribution
